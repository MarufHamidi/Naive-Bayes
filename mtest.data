DEAN FOODS &lt;DF&gt; SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS

CHICAGO, Feb 26 -

Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 30 to
exceed those of the same year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas
told analysts.  In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.  Douglas also said the year's
sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the
prior year.  He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a
share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.  Douglas said
it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter
performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall
earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share.  In 1988, Douglas said Dean should
experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of
the tax reform act alone."  President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988
the company will derive benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.  Dean also said the
company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin
Blenders Inc, West Chicago.  He said the company is a major
shareholder of E.B.I. Foods Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has
licensing arrangements in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.  "It
provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD&gt; we've been after for
years," Douglas told analysts.  Reuter

BROWN-FORMAN &lt;BFDB&gt; SETS STOCK SPLIT, UPS PAYOUT

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb 26 -

Brown-Forman Inc said its board has approved a three-for-two stock
split and a 35 pct increase in the company cash dividend.  The company
cited its improved earnings outlook and continued strong cash flow as
reasons for raising the dividend.  Brown-Forman said the split of its
Class A and Class B common shares would be effective March 13.  The
company said directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on each new
share of both classes of 28 cts, payable April one to holders of
record March 20. Prior to the split, the company had paid 31 cts
quarterly.  Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third
quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a seven pct
increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.  Brown-Forman said nine
month profits declined a bit to 66.0 mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share,
from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08 dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a
second quarter charge of 37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage
operations.  The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
restructuring "are expected to substantially improve Brown-Forman's
earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."  Reuter

JANUARY HOUSING SALES DROP, REALTY GROUP SAYS

WASHINGTON, Feb 26 -

Sales of previously owned homes dropped 14.5 pct in January to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.47 mln units, the National
Association of Realtors (NAR) said.  But the December rate of 4.06 mln
units had been the highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate
set in November 1978, the group said.  "The drop in January is not
surprising considering that a significant portion of December's
near-record pace was made up of sellers seeking to get favorable
capital gains treatment under the old tax laws," said the NAR's John
Tuccillo.  Reuter
