BAHIA COCOA REVIEW

SALVADOR, Feb 26 -

Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone,
alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects
for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been
restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.  The dry period
means the temporao will be late this year.  Arrivals for the week
ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative
total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last
year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was
included in the arrivals figures.  Comissaria Smith said there is
still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as
harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop
estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln
there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers,
middlemen, exporters and processors.  There are doubts as to how much
of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing
dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.  In view of
the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of
their cocoa held on consignment.  Comissaria Smith said spot bean
prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.  Bean
shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited
sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne
to ports to be named.  New crop sales were also light and all to open
ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45
dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per
tonne FOB.  Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at
4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.  April/May butter went at 2.27 times New
York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to
4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at
4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.
Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and
open ports.  Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for
March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New
York Dec for Oct/Dec.  Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and
convertible currency areas.  Liquor sales were limited with
March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs
and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25
times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria
Smith said.  Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln
bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88
crop.  Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be
published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which
ends midday on February 27.  Reuter

DEAN FOODS &lt;DF&gt; SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS

CHICAGO, Feb 26 -

Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 30 to
exceed those of the same year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas
told analysts.  In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor
reported earnings of 40 cts a share.  Douglas also said the year's
sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the
prior year.  He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter
earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a
share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.  Douglas said
it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter
performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall
earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share.  In 1988, Douglas said Dean should
experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of
the tax reform act alone."  President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988
the company will derive benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable
acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.  Dean also said the
company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin
Blenders Inc, West Chicago.  He said the company is a major
shareholder of E.B.I. Foods Ltd, a United Kingdom blender, and has
licensing arrangements in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Japan.  "It
provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp &lt;MCD&gt; we've been after for
years," Douglas told analysts.  Reuter

BROWN-FORMAN &lt;BFDB&gt; SETS STOCK SPLIT, UPS PAYOUT

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb 26 -

Brown-Forman Inc said its board has approved a three-for-two stock
split and a 35 pct increase in the company cash dividend.  The company
cited its improved earnings outlook and continued strong cash flow as
reasons for raising the dividend.  Brown-Forman said the split of its
Class A and Class B common shares would be effective March 13.  The
company said directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on each new
share of both classes of 28 cts, payable April one to holders of
record March 20. Prior to the split, the company had paid 31 cts
quarterly.  Brown-Forman today reported a 37 pct increase in third
quarter profits to 21.6 mln dlrs, or 1.00 dlr a share, on a seven pct
increase in sales to a record 337 mln dlrs.  Brown-Forman said nine
month profits declined a bit to 66.0 mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share,
from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08 dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a
second quarter charge of 37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage
operations.  The company said lower corporate tax rates and the
restructuring "are expected to substantially improve Brown-Forman's
earnings and cash flow in fiscal 1988."  Reuter

JANUARY HOUSING SALES DROP, REALTY GROUP SAYS

WASHINGTON, Feb 26 -

Sales of previously owned homes dropped 14.5 pct in January to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.47 mln units, the National
Association of Realtors (NAR) said.  But the December rate of 4.06 mln
units had been the highest since the record 4.15 mln unit sales rate
set in November 1978, the group said.  "The drop in January is not
surprising considering that a significant portion of December's
near-record pace was made up of sellers seeking to get favorable
capital gains treatment under the old tax laws," said the NAR's John
Tuccillo.  Reuter
